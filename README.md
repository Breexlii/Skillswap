# NOTES TO KEEP IN MIND
This website just highlights my project idea of what we want to create so there was no database used in that means that comments posted, login details, signup or post creations are all fake actions created and will be removed once page reloads

Hopefully planning to work on that project more to improve its ui/ux design making it user friendly and responsive in each device

The website was created using html, css, js
